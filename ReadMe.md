### 04/30/24

I've come back to this project now that I have my own home server, using Ubuntu Server LTS and
running apache2. This means I have access to it on my own network at home. My network will load the 'main'
branch from here on GitHub so I will be using branches to make modifications.
Once this is done, I am going to try and connect this apache server to the internet.

What I got done today, on this actual project was:
- Added a system for loading words from a text file.
- Put this on a server on my home network for testing.
- Started (super barebones) the title page of the game.
